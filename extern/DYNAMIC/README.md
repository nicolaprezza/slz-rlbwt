### Data structures

This library offers space- and time-efficient implementations of some basic succinct/compressed dynamic data structures. Note that at the moment the library does not feature delete operations (only inserts). DYNAMIC features:

- A succinct Searchable Partial Sums with Inserts (SPSI) structure. Space: about 1.3 * n * k bits (n integers of bit-size k). The structure supports also update operations (i.e. modify internal elements).
- A Succinct dynamic bitvector supporting rank/select/access/insert (RSAI) operations. Space: about 1.1 * n bits.
- A gap-compressed dynamic bitvector supporting RSAI operations. Space: about 1.3 * b * log(n/b) bits,  where b is the number of bits set. All operations take log(b) time.
- A dynamic sparse vector (of integers).
- A dynamic string supporting RSAI operations. The user can choose at construction time between fixed-length/gamma/Huffman encoding of the alphabet. All operations take log(n) * log(sigma) time (or log(n) * H0 with Huffman encoding).
- A run-length encoded dynamic string supporting RSAI operations. Space: approximately R*(1.1 * log(sigma) + 2.6 * log(n/R)) bits, where R is the number of runs in the string. All operations take log(R) time.
- A dynamic (left-extend only) entropy/run-length compressed BWT
- A dynamic (left-extend only) entropy/run-length compressed FM-index. This structure consists in the above BWT + a dynamic suffix array sampling

### Algorithms

- Two algorithms to build LZ77 in repetition-aware RAM working space. Both algorithms use a run-length encoded BWT with sparse Suffix array sampling. The first algorithm stores 2 SA samples per BWT run. The second algorithm (much more space efficient) stores 1 SA sample per LZ factor. From the paper "Computing LZ77 in Run-Compressed Space", Alberto Policriti and Nicola Prezza, DCC2016
- An algorithm to build the BWT in run-compressed space
- An algorithm to build LZ77 in nH0(1+o(1)) space and n * log n * H0 time. From the paper "Fast Online Lempel-Ziv Factorization in Compressed Space", Alberto Policriti and Nicola Prezza, SPIRE2015
- An algorithm to build the BWT in high-order compressed space. The algorithm runs in O(n * H_k * log log n) average-case time (good for DNA) and O(n * H_k * log n) worst-case time. From the paper "Average linear time and compressed space construction of the Burrows-Wheeler transform"

The SPSI structure is the building block on which all other structures are based. This structure is implemented with cache-efficient B-trees.

### TODO: 

- Implement delete operations
- Implement a good memory allocator. At the moment the default allocator is used, which results in about 25% of memory being wasted due to fragmentation
- Geometric data structures (predecessor/2D range search)
- Batch inserts

### Download

> git clone https://github.com/nicolaprezza/dynamic

### Compile

Thre library features some example executables. To compile them, firstly create and enter a bin/ directory

> mkdir bin; cd bin

Then, launch cmake as (default build type is release):

> cmake ..

Finally, build the executables:

> make

The above command creates the executables in the bin directory. 

### Usage

The header include/dynamic.hpp contains all type definitions and is all you need to include in your code. The folder algorithms/ contains some algorithms implemented with the library's structures. This is a snapshot of dynamic.hpp:

    /*
     * a succinct searchable partial sum with inserts implemented with cache-efficient
     * B trees.
     */
    typedef spsi<packed_vector,256,16> packed_spsi;

    /*
     * dynamic gap-encoded bitvector
     */
    typedef gap_bitvector<packed_spsi> gap_bv;

    /*
     * dynamic succinct bitvector (about 1.1n bits)
     */
    typedef succinct_bitvector<spsi<packed_vector,8192,16> > suc_bv;

    /*
     * succinct/compressed dynamic string implemented with wavelet trees.
     * user can choose (at construction time) between fixed-length / gamma / Huffman encoding of characters.
     */
    typedef wt_string<suc_bv> wt_str;

    /*
     * run-length encoded (RLE) string. This string uses 1 sparse bitvector
     * for all runs, one dynamic string for run heads, and sigma sparse bitvectors (one per character)
     */
    typedef rle_string<gap_bv, wt_str> rle_str;

    /*
     * RLE string implemented with a run-length encoded wavelet tree. Each
     * WT node is run-length encoded. 
     */
    typedef wt_string<rle_str> wtrle_str;

    /*
     * succinct/compressed BWT (see description of wt_str)
     */
    typedef bwt<wt_str,rle_str> wt_bwt;

    /*
     * run-length encoded BWT
     */
    typedef bwt<rle_str,rle_str> rle_bwt;

    /*
     * dynamic sparse vector: <= m*k + O(m log n/m) bits of space, where k is the maximum
     * number of bits of any integer > 0 and n is the total number of integers.
     */
    typedef sparse_vector<packed_spsi,gap_bv> sparse_vec;

    /*
     * dynamic succinct/entropy compressed FM index. BWT positions are
     * marked with a succinct bitvector
     *
     * ( n*H0 + n + (n/k)*log n )(1+o(1)) bits of space, where k is the SA sample  rate
     *
     */
    typedef fm_index<wt_bwt, suc_bv, packed_spsi> wt_fmi;

    /*
     * dynamic run-length encoded FM index. BWT positions are
     * marked with a gap-encoded bitvector.
     *
     * ( 2*R*log(n/R) + R*H0 + (n/k)*log(n/k) + (n/k)*log n )(1+o(1)) bits of  space, where
     * k is the SA sample rate and R is the number of runs in the BWT
     *
     */
    typedef fm_index<rle_bwt, gap_bv, packed_spsi> rle_fmi;
